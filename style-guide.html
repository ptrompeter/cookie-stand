	<h1> Style guide</h1>
	<h2>Logo</h2>
	<p>The following image is the basis of Pat's Salmon Cookies' Logo and will appear somewhere on each of Pat's pages.  On the front page, it is a background image inserted into buttons on hover.
	<span class="logo"><img src="./img/salmon.png"></span>
	<h2>Fonts</h2>
	<p>Pat's Salmon Cookies uses font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive for headers and highlights, font-family: ‘Palatino Linotype’, ‘Book Antiqua’, Palatino, serif, or 'Raleway' for text, font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica, sans-serif for data, and 	font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive; for dividers, captions, and other elements requiring cursive flourish. </p>
	<h2>Colors</h2>
	<p>Pat's primary background color is #737590.  Articles (primary text boxes) are #CAD6EF. The text on these boxes is black.  Pat's header is black; the principle text on these boxes is #FECD2A, but secondary text is #E07BD5 and buttons are #63DEEE.  At the moment the front page is going for a dated 1980's neon-nightlife kind	of look inspired by a stolen photo of pike place market at night.  Dividers are done in a wholly different style: color: #E79A0B on
	background-color: #CC0F29.  </p>
	<p>At the moment, Pat uses a wholly diffent style for internally facing pages, to distinguish them from public pages.  The primary background color for internal pages is #FFC573.  Black is the prinicple color of font on this background. Text boxes use #38293A as a background-color and #FE7933 for text.  Data boxes use #9A3221 as a background-color and #FFC573 for content.</p>
	<p>CSS for tables are still up for review.</p>
